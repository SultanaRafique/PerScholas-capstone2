                    <h2>Girl's Education matters</h2>
                    “The persistent constraints and deprivations that prevent many of the world’s women from achieving their potential have huge consequences for individuals, families, communities and nations. Expanding women’s ability to make decisions and take advantage of opportunities is critical to improving their lives as well as the world we all share.”

                    — World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim

                <p><h3>Financial Exclusion</h3>Thirty-seven percent (37%) of women worldwide have a bank account compared to 46% of men. Research affirms that children’s lives improve when women are more involved in money management in their households.

                <p><h3>Limited Educational Opportunities</h3> School-aged girls are much better off today than in years past, but there are still far too many who are not completing their education. There are 35 million girls and 31 million boys not attending school in the world’s poorest regions.</p>

                <p><h3>Every child has the right to a safe education</h3>Formal, quality education and access to lifelong learning. However, due to a combination of factors, many girls are forced to leave school while others never have the opportunity to go in the first place.</p>
